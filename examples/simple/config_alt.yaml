# a simple example of a parser configuration file

parser:
  rules:
    # simplest way a rule can be defined:
    # just give the regex. The key will be defined by the rules name â€“ in
    # this case, 'title'. The last group in the regex will be used as the
    # value.
    title: '^name: (\w+)$'
    description: '^description: (.+)$'


    # here we have a regex with multiple groups and a match keyword which
    # assigns them to different keys. This will result in a dictionary with 
    # website['url'], website['server'] and website['name'] keys; and if
    # you export to CSV, the columns will be website_url, website_server and
    # website_name. 
    website:
      regex: '^url: (https?://([^\n/]+)/?(.*))$'
      match:
        # If you want to use the whole regex, use 0.
        url: 1
        server: 2
        name: 3
